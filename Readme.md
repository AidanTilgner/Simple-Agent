# Simple Agent
This is an attempt to make a bare-bones, very simple agent based on LLMs and other technologies. The goal is to have a simple agent for use in various purposes:
1. Experimentation and benchmarking
2. Understanding and learning myself
3. Idk but having three points sounds more solid

## Features
None yet, just started this bad boy. I'm very interested in the [Universal Constructor](https://github.com/substackinc/universal-constructor/) project from the peeps at Substack, so I thought it would be cool to get to understand agents a bit more generally.

I do have some ideas for features. Essentially this thing will be based on my understanding of the anatomy of an autonomous agent, which I've written about [here](https://softwareandsynapses.substack.com/p/the-anatomy-of-an-autonomous-agent). For the memory portion, it will likely integrate with my [Simple Vector Store](https://github.com/AidanTilgner/Simple-Vector-Store) project. For now though, I'm just gonna focus on getting things set up.
