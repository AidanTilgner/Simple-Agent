**Read and write from files**
Can you do me a favor and read the file test.txt. When you've done that, please create a new file called numbers.txt, and write the number that you find in the test.txt file.

**Create a script**
Can you create a script (preferably js) that can fetch the html from a website and output it to a new file, with the filename containing a timestamp and url name? Also, please create this in a new directory called test_scripts.
