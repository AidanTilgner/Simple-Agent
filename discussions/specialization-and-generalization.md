# Aidan: Scope of modes

So I like the concept of modes. Essentially, the agent should be able to have specialization to constrain its reasoning to a set of tools and prompts specialized towards the domain that it's working in. However, it should be able to change between those like a human. Essentially, I'd like the agent to be able to "context-switch".
