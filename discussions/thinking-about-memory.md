Aidan: Thinking about memory
---
When it comes to agent memory, I like to anthropomorphize a bit. Humans have three main types of memory:
1. **Semantic**: memory of facts or concepts, like "cats are mammals" and "tigers will try to eat you"
2. **Episodic**: memory of specific events in time and space, of "episodes"
3. **Procedural**: muscle memory, and how to execute specific tasks and such

These types of memory, although a somewhat arbitrary set of categorizations upon more complex underlying systems, make up our experience. We can build skills and experience through a combination of these types of memory, informing our actions over time. An agent, likewise, could learn and grow in experience over time through an implementation of these different types of memory, and now with semantic search capabilities, that becomes possible.
